# P2P Loan Application

This is a decentralized platform for peer-to-peer loans. The application consists of a **frontend** built with React.js and a **backend** developed using Node.js and Express.js. The frontend provides the user interface for borrowers and lenders, while the backend handles authentication, business logic, and database operations.

**Live Application**: https://borrowhub.vercel.app/
